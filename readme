1. dependencies: Spring Web Services, wsdl4j, devtools. plugin: xjc -- map xsd to classes, jdk 8 and spring boot 2.1.5.RELEASE. jdk 17 is not compitible with xjc.
2. create xsd. Running application will automatically generate entitity classes in the loaneligibility folder.
3. create endpoint and service files. create config file with MessageDispatcherServlet, defaultWsdl11Definition bean (with bean of XsdSchema), and in browser access "http://localhost:8080/ws/loanEligibility.wsdl"
4. test soap API using soapUI.
